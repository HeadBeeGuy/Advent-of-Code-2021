# Advent of Code 2021

Once again, I'm giving Advent of Code a shot! For the last two years I've tried doing it in Rust, but looking back, the only thing I was ever using Rust for was Advent of Code. I think Rust is really neat, but now that my day job is working with Ruby, I think it might be a good idea to further explore Ruby and its capabilities. I also fizzled out pretty early last year due to intimidation to working on some of the later days in Rust. Maybe it's better to solve problems a little less efficiently than not at all!

I'm hoping that I can rope some co-workers in this year, but we'll see!
